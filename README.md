Donors begin by going to our website and registering for anything they wish to contribute.
The contributors' gift goods and locations are saved in our database (note: the location is only accurate to the district/area for privacy confidentiality).


Seekers may now visit our website and search our database for products they need, within their area utilizing the offered search bar.
When a needed gift is discovered near the seeker's location, the seeker can request the donor's email address upon verification.


After the donor and seeker make contact through email, they can meet and the donors can make the contribution on their own.
